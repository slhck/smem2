# smem2

`smem2` is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems. Unlike existing tools, smem2 can report proportional set size (PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.

Because large portions of physical memory are typically shared among multiple applications, the standard measure of memory usage known as resident set size (RSS) will significantly overestimate memory usage. PSS instead measures each application's "fair share" of each shared area to give a realistic measure.

smem2 is based the [original `smem` version](https://www.selenic.com/smem/) and its many forks, with adjustments primarily made in the [fork from GdH](https://github.com/G-dH/smem). This is just a cleaner version of the original `smem` with some additional features and bugfixes, and Python code improvements. The whole credit to the actual functionality goes to the original authors.

smem2 has many features:

 * system overview listing
 * listings by process, mapping, user
 * filtering by process, mapping, or user
 * configurable columns from multiple data sources
 * configurable output units and percentages
 * configurable headers and totals
 * reading live data from /proc
 * lightweight capture tool for embedded systems
 * json output support

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Linux (with procfs) with a reasonably modern kernel (> 2.6.27 or so)

## Usage

Example:

```bash
# basic usage
smem2

# print a system overview
smem2 -w

# group processes by command
smem2 -g

# print totals only
smem2 -T

# print a system overview in detail
smem2 -W

# print as JSON
smem2 -F json
```

## Docker

To build with Docker:

```bash
# build the image
docker build -t smem2 .
# run smem2
docker run --rm -t smem2
# run simple invocation tests
docker run --entrypoint /test.sh --rm -t smem2
```

## History

 * bugfix for "list index out of range" and getcolumns() call
 * added support for *proc/pid/smaps_rollup* (big speed boost for nonmapping part)
 * added *SwapPss, RssAnon, RssFile, RssShmem, PssAnon, PssFile, PssShmem, AvgVss* columns when supported by kernel
 * added *TPss* column = *Pss* + *SwapPss*
 * added *Name* column (process name *comm*) to process view
 * added *-g*/*--groupcmd* group by command view - same executables grouped together
 * added *-b*/*--basename* option: show only name of executables instead of path / full command with aeguments
 * added physical RAM size detection via *dmidecode* in system overview
 * added *-P* process filter can filter by *PID* and name (comm)
 * added *-T/--totalsonly* print totals only
 * added *-i/--ignorecase* option for case insensitive search
 * added *-W/--sysdetail* option with more detailed view on system memory
 * added */dev/zero* mapping summary - memory initialized from /dev/zero can be (wrongly) included as backed by file to *Mapped* measurement in /proc/meminfo. That should be treated as anonymous memory and therefore it is now subtracted from the *Mapped* measurement in smem system view as *Mapped* is used to interpret cached part of the memory consumed by the processes.
 * added warnings about missing kernel features
 * added *-q/--quiet* option to mute warnings
 * added *-c/--columns* option accept "all" string to use all available columns and *+column_name ...* to add columns to default set
 * added *--pid* option to show process memory based on one pid
 * excluded own process from *-P* filtered output
 * fixed -M filter
 * fixed -R option not accepting argument
 * fixed -K option - kernel compression detection
 * fixed AVGUSS - KeyError: 'uss'
